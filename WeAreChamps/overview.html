        <li>Overview Project</li>
        <p>I began by tackling the design. I used GRID within the BODY and configured it with:
            grid-template-columns:
            1fr 1fr; and grid-auto-flow: column; The grid-auto-flow property arranges the divs automatically,
            structuring
            their flow.</p>
        <p>With the design in place, my initial task was to set up the event handler for the button's click action.
            Subsequent to that, I ensured that the connection to the Firebase Realtime Database was operating as
            expected.
        </p>
        <p>Having established the connection, I added the <span style="color: red;">push
                function</span>, a
            feature from Firebase that, when coupled with <span style="color: red;">onValue</span>, enables real-time
            listening for changes within the Firebase DB. This offers an alternative approach to the typical workflow of
            a
            user input message being entered, triggering a button click event, cycling through a loop, and finally
            appending
            it into the designated element, in this case a paragraph element.</p>
        <li>Challenges and what I learned</li>
        <p>I had to seek help for some of the features and to debug parts of the JS code base.</p>
        <li>When you add <span style="color: red;">push(yourDatabase, yourVariableOfInput.value)</span> to your click
            EventListener, it will push the inputValue, in this case <span style="color: red;">"let inputValue =
                textAreaEl.value.trim();"</span>, to the Firebase database once the click EventListener is triggered.
        </li> At
        this point, the actual textContent has not yet been added to the website, but only to your database. By using
        the <span style="color: red;">onValue function from Firebase</span> with the <span style="color: red;">push
            function</span>,
        the onValue function will now listen for any changes inside the Firebase DB, and since you just pushed the value
        of the
        <span style="color: red;">inputValue</span>, it means that onValue will trigger. This "chain reaction" can be
        used to
        your advantage. By adding the JS function that creates and appends the inputValue from the DOM to the website to
        the
        click EventListener, this function will now be triggered as well after the Firebase functions Push and onValue
        have been
        executed.
        <li>
            <p>I added an IF statement with the ! LOGICAL NOT which will prevent users from adding empty text fields:
            </p>
            <p>if (!inputValue || !inputFieldYourNicknameValue) {
                document.getElementById("warningMessage").style.display = "block";
                return; // Exit the function if the inputValue or nickname input is empty
                }</p>
            Here we check that if the text fields are NOT TRUE (meaning false as a Boolean value) then the
            warningMessage will show up as a block element, othewise it wont be displayed
            document.getElementById("warningMessage").style.display = "none";
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the page is refreshed the onValue will be automatically triggered becuase we literally reload the JS
                file. Inside the onValue we have a couple of lines that checks:
            <p>

                <span style="color: red;">while (chatMessagesEl.firstChild) {
                    chatMessagesEl.removeChild(chatMessagesEl.firstChild);
                    }</span>
            </p>
            This while loop will remove all the paragraph elements that was added by the DOM until there is none left.
            Now we can add them back by adding them back from the DB.</p>

            <p>
                <span style="color: red;">DBConvertedToArrayBySnapshot.forEach(function (currentElement) {
                    constructUserMessagesFromTextArea(currentElement);
                    });</span>
                Here we are using the forEach on the snapshot array, and for each element inside the snapshot array (the
                DB STORAGE) we will add a paragraph of that element by the DOM. Hence, we re-create the list back to the
                website. This will prevent duplicated messages to appear
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>How to capitalize first letter of InpuField "your nickname"</li>
        <p>Since we are using the DOM and not innerHTML, it means we cannot add text-transform: capitalize; to the input
            text-field. Instead we are adding a function of
        <p><span style="color: red;">function capitalize(input) {
                return input.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + input.slice(1);
                }</span></p>
        Those are the core struggles I had and check the

        full
        code incl. useful comments</p>
